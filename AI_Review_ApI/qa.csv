What type of language is python? Programming or scripting?,"Python is capable of scripting, but in general sense, it is considered as a general-purpose programming language. To know more about Scripting, you can refer to the Python Scripting Tutorial."
What are Python namespaces?,"A namespace in python refers to the name which is assigned to each object in python. The objects are variables and functions. As each object is created, its name along with space(the address of the outer function in which the object is), gets created. The namespaces are maintained in python like a dictionary where the key is the namespace and value is the address of the object."
What are decorators in Python?,"Decorators are used to add some design patterns to a function without changing its structure. Decorators generally are defined before the function they are enhancing. To apply a decorator we first define the decorator function. Then we write the function it is applied to and simply add the decorator function above the function it has to be applied to. For this, we use the @ symbol before the decorator."
