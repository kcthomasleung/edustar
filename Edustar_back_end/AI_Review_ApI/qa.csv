How many chains can Polkadot connect?,"There is no specific limit to the number of chains that can be connected to the Polkadot network, which is scalable by design. Initial predictions suggest the basic Polkadot design will be able to handle at least dozens and perhaps hundreds of parachains. "
What is the difference between a Parachain and a blockchain connected via a Bridge?,"Parachains are the name given to the parallelized chains that participate in the Polkadot network. Polkadot’s natively supported blockchains achieve consensus using the greater network’s consensus mechanism, both adding to and benefiting from pooled security."
